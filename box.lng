MODEL:
! Design a box at minimum cost that meets
 area, volume, marketing and aesthetic requirements;
 [COST] min = 2*( .05*(d*w + d*h) +.1*w*h);
 [SURFACE]  2*(h*d + h*w + d*w) >= 888;
 [VOLUME]   h*d*w >= 1512;
! These two enforce aesthetics;
 [NOTNARRO] h/w <= .718;
 [NOTHIGH]  h/w >= .518;
! Marketing requires a small footprint;
 [FOOTPRNT] d*w <= 252;
