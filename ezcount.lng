MODEL:
! This model computes the number of ways of selecting
  5 objects from a set of 52 objects;
! This is expressed by 52! / (5! * 47!).  The actual
  computation uses the log-gamma function;
        WAYS = @EXP( @LGM( 53) - @LGM( 6) - @LGM( 48));
! Note that the arguments of the @LGM functions are
  one greater than the corresponding arguments of the
  factorial functions, due to the definition of the
  Gamma function;
