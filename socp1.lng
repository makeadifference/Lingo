MODEL:

!This is a second-order cone problem.  Lingo can exploit 
this if you have both the barrier and global options.
You will need to enable the 'Use Global Solver' options
on the 'Global Solver' options tab, as well as 'Quadratic
Recognition' option on the 'Nonlinear Solver' options tab;

   min = z;
   z^2 >= x^2 + 2*y^2;
   3*x + y > 1;
   @free( x);
   @free( y);
